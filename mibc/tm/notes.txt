Goals for this software:

Definitions:
Each set of data being processed by AnADAMA is called a 'flow'
A flow is composed of one (or more) runs numbers 1 thru n
  The number is based on how many times the flow was re-run due to errors or 
   new tool versions etc
Each run is composted of a number of tasks.
Each task contains input file(s), output file(s), and parent(s)
  who must complete prior to start

There should be a single json full DAG produced for each flow.
This DAG shouldn't change between runs.  Tasks that have (potentially)
completed should still be listled in the DAG.  The TM should
identify them as complete and update the GUI to reflect all
changes.

Eash task should have a unique id associated with it (hex number?)
